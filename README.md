This is the data set containing 2D laser scan and odometry collected by ruanjy in Yuquan campus, Zhejiang University.
Our experiments were performed with a differential drive mobile robot named “Apollo”, which can be seen in Fig. 1.The mobile robot is equipped with a Hokuyo UTM-30LX-EW laser scanner with a scanning frequency of 40 Hz, two wheel encoders that allow to measure the rotation of the wheels and a GY-85 IMU module.

The first experiment was conducted on the second floor of Yongqian Students’ Center in Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China. The mobile robot moved clockwise through a corridor outside a lecture hall. The center lines ofthe corridor consists of two straight lines, one minor arc and one semicircle whose radius is about 8.5 m. The environment is shown in Fig. 2

The second experiment was performed in another environment which is larger, and contains more unstructured objects. The environment, located in the fourth floor of the Chow Yei Ching Science & Technology Building in Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, is 41 m × 34 m in size, which can be seen in Fig. 2
